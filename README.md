# aima-go

Implementation of algorithms from the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*.
Mostly done because I find `aima-python` hard to use since it makes only light use of abstract classes.
This makes it hard to apply to new problems since the interface you must implement is not explicit.
